## Balanced Inventory
**Balanced Minecraft** is a vanilla+ project which aims to make lesser used mechanics in survival more competitive with more popular progression paths. It should make the survival experience overall more novel and challenging, while making progression more satisfying.

**Balanced Inventory** focuses on rebalancing inventory space, and quality of life inventory changes.

Although not required, this mod is intended to be played with other mods in the [Balanced Minecraft](https://modrinth.com/collection/s7K5qS4R) collection.
